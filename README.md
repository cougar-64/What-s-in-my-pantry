# What's in my pantry

The purpose of this application is to help my wife and I know what we have in our pantry (and fridge) at all times regardless of whether we're at home or not. It will have a list of all of the food in our house as well as the quantities of each. I will be able to keep track of how much food I'll have, and the quanitity will change when either my wife or I use some of the food.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been at the store and seen something that wasn't on your list and said to yourself "dang it! I can't remember if I have this in my pantry or not". You don't think you have it so you buy it, go home, and find you already had 9 containers off-brand sour cream and you just bought a tenth? Well, no more sour cream surprises! "What's in my pantry' will keep track of all the food in your house and keep track of how the quantities adjust when you buy more or use some of it.

Above is what my design will look like. Below is how the sequence of events would function given calls to the server and websockets.

### Key features

- Secure login
- Ability to add yourself to multiple pantrys (home, work, grandma's, etc.)
- Ability to add and delete quantity of food

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use HTML to correctly display pages and information. 2 HTML pages, one for login, one for list of active pantrys and adding/deleting food from pantrys.
- **CSS** - My CSS will have good colors, spacing, and styling.
- **React** - React will provide a login and also update the webpage efficiently when food is added/deleted, instead of reloading the entire webpage.
- **Service** - Will have backend Service endpoints for:
   - login
   - creating/adding/removing yourself from a pantry
   - adding/deleting food and food quantities
- **DB/Login** - register/login users stored in Database. Keeps track of what pantrys you're a part of. Cannot view/edit a pantry if you aren't part of it. Login credentials stored securely in database.
- **WebSocket** - When one person makes a change to the pantry, it is broadcast to everyone else who is a part of that pantry.
